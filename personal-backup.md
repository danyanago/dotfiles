## Personal Backup Report

### Types of Data to Back Up

The types of data I value backing up include:

Personal Documents: Important files such as identification scans, financial records, legal documents, and personal projects.

Work and Study Materials: Code repositories, reports, assignments, research notes, and presentation files.

Media Files: Photos, videos, and audio recordings that hold sentimental value.

Application Data: Configuration files, development environment settings, and software license keys.

Communication Records: Emails and chat logs relevant to work or personal history.

### Approximate Data Backup Needs

My total data backup needs are approximately 500 GB to 1 TB. This estimation accounts for personal media, project files, and work-related data, with some headroom for future growth.

### Current Backup Practices

Currently, I back up data using the following methods:

Local Backup: Periodic copies to an external hard drive.

Cloud Storage: Important documents and code repositories are stored on Google Drive and GitHub.

Ad-Hoc Backups: Occasionally emailing critical files to myself as an additional layer of protection.

### Backup Resolution (3-2-1 Rule)

To align with the 3-2-1 backup rule (3 total copies, 2 on different media, 1 offsite), my plan includes:

Primary Copy: Keep the original files on my personal computer.

Local Backup (Second Copy): Automate backups to an external hard drive or NAS (Network Attached Storage) every week.

Cloud Backup (Third Copy): Implement regular backups to a cloud storage service like Backblaze or Google Drive, ensuring offsite protection.

Verification: Schedule monthly checks to ensure backup integrity and conduct periodic test restores.

This plan will provide redundancy, resilience, and ease of recovery in case of data loss.
