## Issue & Improvements 

### Polish & Documentation

### Issue: 

Task 3: Removing `--update` from the flags

Now that the install was completed and worked I couldn't remove it. 

PS: Lesson learned.

### Future Improvement: 

Task 1: It's safe to use the USER variable so next time I will not have to hardcode the username. 

PS: Instructor recommendation and good improvement for my future self.


### General Improvements for future self:

* Add support for more package managers

* Automate full setup with a Makefile

* Expand install scripts for more software
