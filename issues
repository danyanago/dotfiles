## Issue & Improvements 

### Polish & Documentation

### Issue: 

Task 3: Removing `--update` from the flags

Now that the install was completed and worked I couldn't remove it. But I think this issue can be marked as resolved because now if i was to start over in a new instance i would have the wright script.

PS: Lesson learned.

### Future Improvement: 

Task 1: It's safe to use the USER variable so next time I will not have to hardcode the username. 

PS: Instructor recommendation and good improvement for my future self.


### General Improvements for future self:

* Add support for more package managers

* Automate full setup with a Makefile

* Expand install scripts for more software

* Write additional install scripts for other common dev tools 

* Refactor research notes (fs-research.md, personal-backup.md) into a `docs/` folder
